The performance at the theater last night was abysmal. The actors delivered their lines in a monotonous, boring manner that made the entire show feel unbearable. The plot was banal and predictable, leaving the audience feeling restless. The set design was grossly defective, with props falling apart mid-scene. Overall, it was a dreadful experience, and many left the theater early, disgusted and disappointed by such a dismal production.
